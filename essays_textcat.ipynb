We use the car to go every where rather it's to the grocery store , work or just to go hang out with friends and family! Just traveling in general. Well imagine if we limited the usage of cars in our community! I strongly believe that doing this would have many advantages to our community for many reasons like it will make people less stressful all the time, there would be less accidents and it would definitly be better for the environment.\\n\\nOMG I ran out of gas or OH my i have to take my car to the shop to get it fixed is usually the two main things you hear people stay when the word \\\"car\\\" comes up. Having a car comes with alot of stress because it of expenses and having to take of its every need and usually when someone is stressed they are not the best person you wanna have a conversation with. I think that if we limit the usage of cars a lot of people in the community will be alot happier. According to the article\\n\\n\\\"Car-free Cities\\\"\\n\\nby\\n\\nElisabeth Rosenthal in source 2 a lady name Heidrun Walter says \\\" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way.\\\" and i think that is a perfect example of limited car usauage can make a person happier.\\n\\nIn addition, I feel that if that if we limit the car usage in our community it will make this community a much safer environment. We hear and see about many car accidents in our country and community and cars can be very very dangerous. People often get injuried and/or die in car recks to. So limitting the car usage in the communitry will keep people more safe and most importantly alive . Kids will be able to run aroumd the neighborhood and play with their friends and also cross the street safely without the disruption of a car coming and stopping them from what they are doing\\u00a0 because they do not wants to get hurt from the car coming because they do not know who is driving the car.\\n\\nLast but not least limiting the use of car usage in the community because it would definitly be better for the environment. In science class we often talk about how cars polute the air and just mess up the waehter in the car and me my self i can also feel the car changing the more i see cars more cars in the streets. I think that it makes the days hotter and i also think that it makes the winters come around earlier and it makes it alot more colder. I live in the Sunshine florida and in the south. So all year round its usually hot extremly hot but has i realize more people are driving around the winers seem ALOT more cold then it usually is and the cold last for longer periods of time.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I belive that if we limit the car usuage in our community it will make it a better place for many reasons. Like it will make people less stressful and\\u00a0 be happier, there will be less accidents on the road and it will also help the environment a lot. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0    \",\n          \"Imagine being a top scientist at NASA and Viking 1 spacecraft \\\"spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\\\" A lot of people thought of alien life possibility, but others thought it to be just a natural landform. What would your thoughts be about the image? The face of Mars is a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.\\n\\nTo begin, there are similar landforms on Earth to the one on Mars. As stated in the text, \\\"what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\\\" Also stated in the text is Garvin giving his opinion, \\\"it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\\\"\\n\\nAnother issue with the alien life theory is the fact that NASA has high quality cameras. Quoting the text, \\\"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\\\" In the result of having high quality pictures you could see small details clearly. As stated in the article Garvin said, \\\" 'so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!' \\\" Concluding that statement nothing other than the landform that had resembled a face was seen on Mars.\\n\\nFinally, there wasn't enough evidence to support the claim of alien life on Mars. The first pictures were blurry and had haze or cloud coverage. This theory was more popular on the online world than in the science world. As stated in the text, \\\"the 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\\\" This proves that this might be just for publicity and attention. There has been many conspiracy theorists.\\n\\nUltimately, the face on Mars is just a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.       \",\n          \"The face of Mars could not be created by aliens. It is a land form created by the conditions of mars and looks like a face only by coincidence. Mesa's are common in this area of Mars and there are many others like this one just without the same shadows which makes the appearance of a human's face.\\n\\nOut of so many different land forms in Cydonia why should this be any different. In the second paragrapgh of the article, it stated that the Cydonia region is known for its buttes and mesas. The face of Mars is just another mesa no different that any other one except for its unique shadows. It is strange to see a formation on an supposedly uninhabited planet that depicts a \\\"human\\\" face. Espescially when no human has ever set foot on the planet of Mars before. But at the same time, that is all the more reason to believe that this is nothing more that a weird coincidence since no person has ever been there.\\n\\nTo conspiracy theorists dismay, this strange landform is nothing more than martian butte or mesa and a weird coincidence. It is an interesting formation that stumped and puzzled scientests all over the world. But we now know the formation is not anything that will reveal alien lifeforms or alien activity.        \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          4,\n          6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We use the car to go every where rather it's to the grocery store , work or just to go hang out with friends and family! Just traveling in general. Well imagine if we limited the usage of cars in our community! I strongly believe that doing this would have many advantages to our community for many reasons like it will make people less stressful all the time, there would be less accidents and it would definitly be better for the environment.\\n\\nOMG I ran out of gas or OH my i have to take my car to the shop to get it fixed is usually the two main things you hear people stay when the word \\\"car\\\" comes up. Having a car comes with alot of stress because it of expenses and having to take of its every need and usually when someone is stressed they are not the best person you wanna have a conversation with. I think that if we limit the usage of cars a lot of people in the community will be alot happier. According to the article\\n\\n\\\"Car-free Cities\\\"\\n\\nby\\n\\nElisabeth Rosenthal in source 2 a lady name Heidrun Walter says \\\" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way.\\\" and i think that is a perfect example of limited car usauage can make a person happier.\\n\\nIn addition, I feel that if that if we limit the car usage in our community it will make this community a much safer environment. We hear and see about many car accidents in our country and community and cars can be very very dangerous. People often get injuried and/or die in car recks to. So limitting the car usage in the communitry will keep people more safe and most importantly alive . Kids will be able to run aroumd the neighborhood and play with their friends and also cross the street safely without the disruption of a car coming and stopping them from what they are doing\\u00a0 because they do not wants to get hurt from the car coming because they do not know who is driving the car.\\n\\nLast but not least limiting the use of car usage in the community because it would definitly be better for the environment. In science class we often talk about how cars polute the air and just mess up the waehter in the car and me my self i can also feel the car changing the more i see cars more cars in the streets. I think that it makes the days hotter and i also think that it makes the winters come around earlier and it makes it alot more colder. I live in the Sunshine florida and in the south. So all year round its usually hot extremly hot but has i realize more people are driving around the winers seem ALOT more cold then it usually is and the cold last for longer periods of time.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I belive that if we limit the car usuage in our community it will make it a better place for many reasons. Like it will make people less stressful and\\u00a0 be happier, there will be less accidents on the road and it will also help the environment a lot. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0    \",\n          \"Imagine being a top scientist at NASA and Viking 1 spacecraft \\\"spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\\\" A lot of people thought of alien life possibility, but others thought it to be just a natural landform. What would your thoughts be about the image? The face of Mars is a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.\\n\\nTo begin, there are similar landforms on Earth to the one on Mars. As stated in the text, \\\"what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\\\" Also stated in the text is Garvin giving his opinion, \\\"it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\\\"\\n\\nAnother issue with the alien life theory is the fact that NASA has high quality cameras. Quoting the text, \\\"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\\\" In the result of having high quality pictures you could see small details clearly. As stated in the article Garvin said, \\\" 'so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!' \\\" Concluding that statement nothing other than the landform that had resembled a face was seen on Mars.\\n\\nFinally, there wasn't enough evidence to support the claim of alien life on Mars. The first pictures were blurry and had haze or cloud coverage. This theory was more popular on the online world than in the science world. As stated in the text, \\\"the 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\\\" This proves that this might be just for publicity and attention. There has been many conspiracy theorists.\\n\\nUltimately, the face on Mars is just a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.       \",\n          \"The face of Mars could not be created by aliens. It is a land form created by the conditions of mars and looks like a face only by coincidence. Mesa's are common in this area of Mars and there are many others like this one just without the same shadows which makes the appearance of a human's face.\\n\\nOut of so many different land forms in Cydonia why should this be any different. In the second paragrapgh of the article, it stated that the Cydonia region is known for its buttes and mesas. The face of Mars is just another mesa no different that any other one except for its unique shadows. It is strange to see a formation on an supposedly uninhabited planet that depicts a \\\"human\\\" face. Espescially when no human has ever set foot on the planet of Mars before. But at the same time, that is all the more reason to believe that this is nothing more that a weird coincidence since no person has ever been there.\\n\\nTo conspiracy theorists dismay, this strange landform is nothing more than martian butte or mesa and a weird coincidence. It is an interesting formation that stumped and puzzled scientests all over the world. But we now know the formation is not anything that will reveal alien lifeforms or alien activity.        \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.0449288849735427,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 6.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3.0,\n          4.0,\n          6.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We use the car to go every where rather it's to the grocery store , work or just to go hang out with friends and family! Just traveling in general. Well imagine if we limited the usage of cars in our community! I strongly believe that doing this would have many advantages to our community for many reasons like it will make people less stressful all the time, there would be less accidents and it would definitly be better for the environment.\\n\\nOMG I ran out of gas or OH my i have to take my car to the shop to get it fixed is usually the two main things you hear people stay when the word \\\"car\\\" comes up. Having a car comes with alot of stress because it of expenses and having to take of its every need and usually when someone is stressed they are not the best person you wanna have a conversation with. I think that if we limit the usage of cars a lot of people in the community will be alot happier. According to the article\\n\\n\\\"Car-free Cities\\\"\\n\\nby\\n\\nElisabeth Rosenthal in source 2 a lady name Heidrun Walter says \\\" When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way.\\\" and i think that is a perfect example of limited car usauage can make a person happier.\\n\\nIn addition, I feel that if that if we limit the car usage in our community it will make this community a much safer environment. We hear and see about many car accidents in our country and community and cars can be very very dangerous. People often get injuried and/or die in car recks to. So limitting the car usage in the communitry will keep people more safe and most importantly alive . Kids will be able to run aroumd the neighborhood and play with their friends and also cross the street safely without the disruption of a car coming and stopping them from what they are doing\\u00a0 because they do not wants to get hurt from the car coming because they do not know who is driving the car.\\n\\nLast but not least limiting the use of car usage in the community because it would definitly be better for the environment. In science class we often talk about how cars polute the air and just mess up the waehter in the car and me my self i can also feel the car changing the more i see cars more cars in the streets. I think that it makes the days hotter and i also think that it makes the winters come around earlier and it makes it alot more colder. I live in the Sunshine florida and in the south. So all year round its usually hot extremly hot but has i realize more people are driving around the winers seem ALOT more cold then it usually is and the cold last for longer periods of time.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I belive that if we limit the car usuage in our community it will make it a better place for many reasons. Like it will make people less stressful and\\u00a0 be happier, there will be less accidents on the road and it will also help the environment a lot. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0    \",\n          \"Imagine being a top scientist at NASA and Viking 1 spacecraft \\\"spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.\\\" A lot of people thought of alien life possibility, but others thought it to be just a natural landform. What would your thoughts be about the image? The face of Mars is a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.\\n\\nTo begin, there are similar landforms on Earth to the one on Mars. As stated in the text, \\\"what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.\\\" Also stated in the text is Garvin giving his opinion, \\\"it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.\\\"\\n\\nAnother issue with the alien life theory is the fact that NASA has high quality cameras. Quoting the text, \\\"each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\\\" In the result of having high quality pictures you could see small details clearly. As stated in the article Garvin said, \\\" 'so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!' \\\" Concluding that statement nothing other than the landform that had resembled a face was seen on Mars.\\n\\nFinally, there wasn't enough evidence to support the claim of alien life on Mars. The first pictures were blurry and had haze or cloud coverage. This theory was more popular on the online world than in the science world. As stated in the text, \\\"the 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!\\\" This proves that this might be just for publicity and attention. There has been many conspiracy theorists.\\n\\nUltimately, the face on Mars is just a natural landform. There's similar landforms on Earth, high pixel photos taken, and not enough reliable information to support the alien life theory.       \",\n          \"The face of Mars could not be created by aliens. It is a land form created by the conditions of mars and looks like a face only by coincidence. Mesa's are common in this area of Mars and there are many others like this one just without the same shadows which makes the appearance of a human's face.\\n\\nOut of so many different land forms in Cydonia why should this be any different. In the second paragrapgh of the article, it stated that the Cydonia region is known for its buttes and mesas. The face of Mars is just another mesa no different that any other one except for its unique shadows. It is strange to see a formation on an supposedly uninhabited planet that depicts a \\\"human\\\" face. Espescially when no human has ever set foot on the planet of Mars before. But at the same time, that is all the more reason to believe that this is nothing more that a weird coincidence since no person has ever been there.\\n\\nTo conspiracy theorists dismay, this strange landform is nothing more than martian butte or mesa and a weird coincidence. It is an interesting formation that stumped and puzzled scientests all over the world. But we now know the formation is not anything that will reveal alien lifeforms or alien activity.        \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          4,\n          6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_texts\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17307,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"People tend use car basically live day car use car grocery store work hang friend family travel general imagine limit usage car community strongly believe advantage community reason like people stressful time accident definitly well environment OMG run gas oh car shop fix usually main thing hear people stay word car come have car come alot stress expense have need usually stress good person wanna conversation think limit usage car lot people community alot happy accord article car free city Elisabeth Rosenthal source lady Heidrun Walter say car tense happy way think perfect example limited car usauage person happy addition feel limit car usage community community safe environment hear car accident country community car dangerous People injurie and/or die car reck limitte car usage communitry people safe importantly alive kid able run aroumd neighborhood play friend cross street safely disruption car come stop want hurt car come know drive car limit use car usage community definitly well environment science class talk car polute air mess waehter car self feel car change car car street think make day hotter think make winter come early make alot cold live Sunshine florida south year round usually hot extremly hot realize people drive winer ALOT cold usually cold long period time conclusion belive limit car usuage community well place reason like people stressful happy accident road help environment lot\",\n          \"imagine scientist NASA vike spacecraft spot shadowy likeness human face lot people think alien life possibility think natural landform thought image face Mars natural landform similar landform Earth high pixel photo take reliable information support alien life theory begin similar landform Earth Mars state text picture actually show martian equivalent butte mesa- landform common American West state text Garvin give opinion remind Middle Butte Snake River Plain Idaho issue alien life theory fact NASA high quality camera quote text pixel image span 1.56 meter compare meter pixel good vike photo result have high quality picture small detail clearly state article Garvin say object picture like airplane ground egyptian style pyramid small shack conclude statement landform resemble face see Mars finally evidence support claim alien life Mars picture blurry haze cloud coverage theory popular online world science world state text face Mars pop icon star Hollywood film appear book magazine radio talk show haunt grocery store checkout line year prove publicity attention conspiracy theorist ultimately face Mars natural landform similar landform Earth high pixel photo take reliable information support alien life theory\",\n          \"face Mars create alien land form create condition mar look like face coincidence Mesa common area Mars like shadow make appearance human face different land form Cydonia different second paragrapgh article state Cydonia region know butte mesa face Mars mesa different unique shadow strange formation supposedly uninhabited planet depict human face espescially human set foot planet Mars time reason believe weird coincidence person conspiracy theorist dismay strange landform martian butte mesa weird coincidence interesting formation stump puzzle scientest world know formation reveal alien lifeform alien activity\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
